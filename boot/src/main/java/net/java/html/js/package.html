        <div>Essential support for those who write <em>native</em> methods communicating directly with JavaScript.</div>
        Mix your Java and JavaScript code seamlessly - perform calls from Java
        to JavaScript and back with as much freedom as JavaScript gives you
        and as much type safety you can get from Java. Execute your code
        in a headless testing environment or in a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/FXBrwsr">JavaFX WebView</a>. 
        When done, deploy to <a href="http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org">real browsers</a>.
        
        <h3>Simple Meaning of World</h3>
        The whole support is build around @<a href="JavaScriptBody.html">JavaScriptBody</a>
        annotation. Use it to create parametrised JavaScript snippet easily
        accessible from Java:
<pre>
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = {"x", "y"}, body = "return x + y;")
<b>private static native int</b> meaning(<b>int</b> x, <b>int</b> y);
</pre>
        The above defines method <em>meaning</em> which sums two JavaScript
        objects together (being invoked inside of a JavaScript interpreter).
        The <em>meaning</em> method now becomes a properly typed Java
        surface to your JavaScript code which can be directly
        called from the rest of your Java code:
<pre>        
<b>public static void</b> main(String... args) {
  <b>assert</b> 42 == meaning(40, 2) : <em>"Meaning of World should be 42!"</em>;
}
</pre>
        <em>Real code tip:</em> real classes using this technique are
        available online:
        <a target="top" href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans-html4j/tree/release-1.7.1/boot/src/test/java/org/netbeans/html/boot/impl/JsMethods.java">JsMethods</a> and
        <a target="top" href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans-html4j/tree/release-1.7.1/json-tck/src/main/java/net/java/html/js/tests/Bodies.java">Bodies</a>.
        <p></p>
        <em>Editing hint:</em> one can see the list of arguments of the
        <em>meaning</em> is now duplicated - it is once specified in Java, 
        and once inside of the {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} 
        array of <code>args</code>. This is necessary to keep the names of 
        arguments accessible during runtime. However don't despair - there
        is a code completion for the value of <code>args</code> attribute!
        Just type the Java signature first and then press Ctrl+Space and the
        right parameter names will be inserted for you.
        
        <a name="#library"><h3>Including JavaScript Libraries</h3></a>

        Large amount of JavaScript code is easier to be delivered in whole
        files rather than {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody small code snippets} -
        that is also possible thanks to {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptResource}
        annotation. Imagine file <code>mul.js</code> with following content:
<pre> 
<b>function</b> <em>mul</em>(x, y) { <b>return</b> x * y; }
</pre>
        Place the file next to your class and reference it with 
        {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptResource the annotation}:
<pre>
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptResource}("mul.js") <b>class</b> Mul {

  {@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = { "x", "y" }, body = "return <b>mul</b>(x, y);")
  <b>public static native int</b> multiply(int x, int y);

  <b>public static void</b> main(String... args) {
    <b>assert</b> 42 == multiply(6, 7) : <em>"Meaning of World should be 42!"</em>;
  }
}
</pre>
        All the Java methods annotated {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}
        can now reference everything that is in the <code>mul.js</code> file -
        e.g. the body of the <code>multiply</code> method can reference the
        function <code>mul</code> and use it.
        <p></p>
        <em>Real code tip:</em>
        <a target="top" href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans-html4j/tree/release-1.7.1/ko4j/src/main/java/org/netbeans/html/ko4j/Knockout.java">this</a>
        is the way 
        the <a target="top" href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a> library
        is included in its <em>ko4j</em> library.
        
        <h3>Callback to Java</h3>
        
        Often JavaScript code needs to call back into the Java classes.
        For example when a button in a browser is pressed and your code would
        like to invoke a runnable to handle such situation:
<pre> 
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = {"id", "r"}, {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody#javacall() javacall} = true, body = "\n" + 
"       document.getElementById(id).onclick = function() {\n" + 
"        r.<em>{@code @}java.lang.Runnable::run()</em>();\n" + 
"       };\n" + 
"    ")
<b>public static native void</b> onClick(String id, Runnable r);
</pre>
        As can be seen, there is a special syntax (starting with <b>@</b>) to 
        properly identify the right Java method to call on a Java object passed
        into the JavaScript interpreter. The syntax starts with a fully
        qualified name of the class, followed by <b>::</b> and name of the 
        method including signature of its parameters. In case of runnable,
        this is just <em>()</em> as the method has no parameters, but the
        signature can be more complicated. For example in case of following method
<pre><b>static int</b> compare(<b>int</b> i1, String s1, <b>int</b> i2, String s2)
</pre>        
        it would be <em>(ILjava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;)</em> (btw. the
        return type is not included in the signature). The actual parameters 
        then follows. The JavaScript call to such compare method would then
        look like:
<pre>{@code @}the.pkg.Clazz::compare(ILjava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/String;)(1, 'One', 2, 'Two');
</pre>        
        This syntax gives enough flexibility, helps to properly select one
        of overloaded methods and follows the tradition of previous attempts to
        provide JavaScript to Java calling conventions.
        <p></p>
        Please note that to turn the special Java callback syntax on, one
        needs to set the {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody#javacall()}
        attribute to <b>true</b>. The callback syntax consists of
        following parts:
        <p></p>
        <pre>[instance.]@classname::methodname(signature)(arguments)</pre>
        <ul>
            <li><b>instance</b> - must be present when calling an 
                instance method and must be absent when calling a 
                static method</li>
            <li><b>classname</b> - fully qualified name of the class in 
                which the method is declared 
            </li>
            <li><b>signature</b> - internal JVM method signature 
                (as specified at 
                <a target="top" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/types.html#wp16432">JNI type Signatures</a>) 
                without the trailing signature of the method return type</li>
            <li><b>arguments</b> - the actual values to pass to the called Java method
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is the <a target="top" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/types.html#wp16432">JNI type signatures table</a>
            one can use to convert
            Java parameters to JVM's internal <em>letter</em> based 
            representation:</p>
        
        <table border=1 width='100%'>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Type Signature</b></td>
                <td><b>Java Type</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Z</td>
              <td>boolean</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>B</td>
              <td>byte</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>C</td>
              <td>char</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>S</td>
              <td>short</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>I</td>
              <td>int</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>J</td>
              <td>long</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>F</td>
              <td>float</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>D</td>
              <td>double</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>L fully-qualified-class ;</td>
              <td>fully-qualified-class</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>[ type</td>
              <td>type[]</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p></p>
        <em>Editing hint:</em> The callback syntax may seem complicated at
        first, however there is an associated <b>annotation processor</b> 
        that checks the syntax and verifies the referenced class and
        method with the requested signature exist. If it does not, the
        <em>compilation fails offering correct alternatives</em>. 
        Thus don't despair seeing the syntax, make sure you get the
        fully qualified name of the callback class right. 
        You'll get warning and help 
        if there is a typo in the specified signature then -
        during compilation of your code.
        
        <h3>Overloaded Methods</h3>
        
        Specifying the actual callback signature is important in case of 
        overloaded methods. Imagine a class:
<pre>
<b>package</b> x.y.z;
<b>class</b> Handler {
  <b>int</b> pulse() {
    <b>return</b> 1;
  }
  <b>int</b> pulse(<b>int</b> howMuch) {
    <b>return</b> howMuch;
  }
  <b>int</b> pulse(<b>long</b> evenMore) {
    <b>return</b> (<b>int</b>) (5 + evenMore);
  }
}</pre>        
        you then need to choose in {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} 
        the appropriate method to call:
<pre>
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = { "h" }, javacall = <b>true</b>, <em>// you want to process the @ syntax</em>
  body = "<b>return</b> h.@x.y.z.Handler::pulse()() +" + <em>// the call to no argument method</em>
    "h.@x.y.z.Handler::pulse(I)(10) +" + <em>// the call to method with integer argument</em>
    "h.@x.y.z.Handler::pulse(J)(10);" <em>// the call to method with long argument</em>
  )
  <b>static native void</b> threePulsesFromJavaScript(Handler h);
  <b>static</b> {
    <b>assert</b> 26 == threePulsesFromJavaScript(<b>new</b> Handler());
  }
</pre>
        <p>
        To avoid ambiguity, the specification of the correct signature is 
        required on every call. However, to simplify the development,
        there is an annotation processor to
        verify the signature really refers to an existing method.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Arrays by Copy</h3>
        
        It is possible to exchange arrays between Java and JavaScript. Some
        implementations can pass arrays by reference, however in some systems
        this is hard to achieve. To choose the least common denominator, 
        the TCK for behavior of {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} requires
        the arrays to be always transfered by a copy. As such following code:
        <pre>
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = {"arr"}, body = "arr[0] = null;")
<b>private static native void</b> uselessModify(String[] arr);
<b>public static void</b> main(String... args) {
  String[] hello = { "Hello", "World!" };
  uselessModify(arr);
  System.out.println(arr[0] + " " + arr[1]);
}            
</pre>
        will still print <em>Hello World!</em> in spite the JavaScript code
        sets the 0-th array element to <code>null</code>. Because the array
        is passed as a copy, such assignment has no effect on the Java array.
        <p></p>
        In case one needs to modify an array in a JavaScript and use its 
        values in Java, one has to return the array back as a return value:
        <pre>        
{@code @}{@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}(args = {"arr"}, body = "arr[0] = 'Ahoy'; return arr;")
<b>private static native</b> Object[] usefulModify(String[] arr);
<b>public static void</b> main(String... args) {
  String[] hello = { "Hello", "World!" };
  Object[] ret = usefulModify(arr);
  System.out.println(ret[0] + " " + ret[1]);
}            
</pre>
        now the program prints <em>Ahoy World!</em> as the modified array
        is returned back and converted (by a copy) into a Java <code>Object[]</code>
        (but of course the <code>ret != hello</code>). Usually the copy based
        passing of arrays works OK. It is however good to keep it in mind to 
        avoid unwanted surprises.
        
        <h3>Instance Reference to JavaScript Object</h3>
        
        When writing wrappers around existing JavaScript libraries, it may be
        useful to hold a reference to some JavaScript object from a Java 
        instance and use it later.
<pre>
<b>class</b> WrapperAroundJsObj {
  <b>private final</b> Object js;

  WrapperAroundJsObj() {
    js = initValue();
  }

  <b>public void</b> set(int v) {
    setValue(js, v);
  }

  {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody @JavaScriptBody}(args = {}, body = "return { value : 0 };")
  <b>private static native</b> Object initValue();

  {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody @JavaScriptBody}(
    args = { "js", "v" }, body = "js.value = v;", wait4js = false
  )
  <b>private static native void</b> setValue(Object js, int v);
}            
</pre>      
        The type of the Java reference is {@link java.lang.Object}. 
        From a Java perspective it has no additional methods or fields, however
        its properties can be manipulated from JavaScript. Send the object back
        to JavaScript by passing it as a parameter of some method 
        (like the <code>setValue</code> one) and perform necessary JavaScript
        calls or changes on it.

        <h3>undefined === null</h3>
        <a name='undefined'></a>

        JavaScript recognizes two <em>empty</em> values: <code>null</code> and
        <code>undefined</code>. Java has just <code>null</code>.

        For purposes of simplicity and easier inter-operability, <code>undefined</code>
        values returned from {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody @JavaScriptBody}
        annotated methods are converted to <code>null</code>. In the following
        example both methods return <code>null</code>:
<pre>
  {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody @JavaScriptBody}(
    args = {}, body = "var empty = {}; return empty.x;"
  )
  <b>private static native</b> Object returnUndefined();
  {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody @JavaScriptBody}(
    args = {}, body = "var empty = {}; empty.x = null; return empty.x;"
  )
  <b>private static native</b> Object returnNull();
}
</pre>
        This is the behavior since version 1.4.
        
        <h3>Post Process Classes</h3>
        <a name="post-process"></a>

        Classes with {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotated methods need to
        be post processed before they can be used - e.g. their <code>native</code>
        body needs to be generated to call into JavaScript (btw. the code is performed
        via {@link org.netbeans.html.boot.spi.Fn}). There are three ways
        such post processing can happen.
        <p></p>
        <b>Compile time</b> processing - this is the preferred method that
        most of the <a href="http://html.java.net">Html Java APIs</a> are using. 
        Just include following plugin configuration into your <code>pom.xml</code>
        and your classes will be ready for execution as soon as <em>process-classes</em>
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a> phase is over:
<pre> 
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.netbeans.html&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;html4j-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${net.java.html.version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;js-classes&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;process-js-annotations&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
        This plugin works in orchestration with 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">annotation
        processor</a> associated with {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody}
        and {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptResource} - the processor creates
        list of files that need post-processing. The 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        plugin reads these files, processes classes mentioned in them and 
        modifies (and deletes at the end) the files to not include classes
        already processed.
        <p></p>
        <b>Instrumentation Agent</b> - one can do processing in runtime 
        using JDK's {@link java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer instrumentation}
        abilities. The JAR artifact of <code>org.netbeans.html:net.java.html.boot</code>
        contains an <code>Agent-Class</code> and <code>Premain-Class</code> 
        definitions in its manifest. As such one can launch the Java virtual
        machine with
<pre>
$ java -javaagent:jarpath=net.java.html.boot-x.y.jar
</pre>        
        and the runtime will take care of processing bytecode of classes 
        not yet processed in compile time before they are loaded into the
        virtual machine. 
        <p></p>
        <b>Special classloading</b> - when booting your application with
        {@link net.java.html.boot.BrowserBuilder} there is a 3rd option of
        processing the classes. If there are some classes not yet processed
        (remember the files listing them generated by the 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">annotation
        processor</a>), the {@link net.java.html.boot.BrowserBuilder#showAndWait() launching method}
        will create a special classloader to that does the processing before
        loading the bytecode into the virtual machine.
        <p></p>
        The options are rich, however to avoid any troubles (as the runtime
        processing needs to also include <code>asm-5.0.jar</code> on application
        classpath), it is recommended
        to perform the <b>compile time</b> processing.
        
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        
        There are many ways to start developing 
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a> application. 
        However to be sure one chooses the most recent setup, it is recommended
        to switch to good old command line and use a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Knockout4Java">Maven archetype</a>
        associated with every version of this project. Just type:
<pre>      
$ mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apidesign.html \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=knockout4j-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=x.y
</pre>
        Answer few questions (for example choose myfirstbrwsrpage as artifactId) and then you can:
<pre>
$ cd myfirstbrwsrpage
$ mvn process-classes exec:java
</pre>
        In a few seconds (or minutes if 
        <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        decides to download the whole Internet of dependencies) you should 
        see a sample Hello World application. It is basically composed from one 
        Java and one HTML file:
<pre>
$ ls src/main/java/**/DataModel.java
$ ls src/main/webapp/pages/index.html
</pre>
        Play with them, modify them and enjoy
        <a href="http://html.java.net">Html for Java</a>!

        <h3>Mixed Java/JavaScript Debugging</h3>
        </a>
        
        <p>
        The following video shows how easy it is to use 
        NetBeans 8.0, JDK8 to debug an application that intermixes Java 
        and JavaScript calls. One can put breakpoints into Java part, 
        as well as JavaScript source code, inspect Java as well 
        as JavaScript variables and switch between these two
