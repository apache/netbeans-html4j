MSG_Completion_GET=The GET method means retrieve whatever information \
 (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. \
 If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, \
 it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in \
 the response and not the source text of the process, \
 unless that text happens to be the output of the process.

MSG_Completion_HEAD=The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server \
 MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. The metainformation \
 contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be \
 identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. \
 This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied \
 by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. \
 This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, \
 accessibility, and recent modification.

MSG_Completion_POST=The POST method is used to request that the origin server \
 accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource \
 identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow \
 a uniform method to cover annotation of existing resources,\ 
 posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar \
 group of articles, providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a \
 form, to a data-handling process or extending a database through an append operation. \
 The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server \
 and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate \
 to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, \
 a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, \
 or a record is subordinate to a database.

MSG_Completion_PUT=The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored \
 under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already \
 existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified \
 version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does \
 not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined \
 as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can \
 create the resource with that URI. If a new resource is created, the origin \
 server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response. \
 If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) \
 response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. \
 If the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an \
 appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. \
 The recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) \
 headers that it does not understand or implement and MUST return \
 a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.

MSG_Completion_DELETE=The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete \
 the resource identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden \
 by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client \
 cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if \
 the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action \
 has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate \
 success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete \
 the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.
